# BranchToTag  
### Python based script to create git tags for the given branch names.   
Recently I had to come up with a less time consuming way to cleanup a Git repository with some 200+ branches, Where we also wanted to archive few branches as tags. 
  
## Features  
   - Create git Tags and delete the tagged branches.  
   - Delete the given branches without tagging.   
   - Maintain the history of the script process under clean_up_history.json  
  
## How To Use (Changes required in main.py)  

1. Set your local repo path  
```  
LOCAL_REPO_PATH = "/Users/PycharmProjects/your_local_project_git_folder/"  
```  

2. If you want to create git tags and delete the tagged branches.   

```  
if __name__ == '__main__':  
 set_local_repo() 
 branches = ['branch_name_1', branch_name_2 ...] 
 create_tags(branches)````  
```

 3. If you want to just delete some git branches  

```
if __name__ == '__main__':  
 set_local_repo() 
 branches = ['branch_name_1', branch_name_2 ...] 
 delete_branches(branches)```  
```  

4. If you wish to change the prefix of the tag modify this. 

```
TAG_PREFIX = "archive"
```

## Run   
    Main.py  
  
## clean_up_history.json  
Either the script is creating tag or deleting a given a branch. It will be recorded in the clean_up_history.json for future reference.   
```yaml  
{  
 //name of the branch which are already processed by the script  
 "processed": ["master"],  
 // name of the branch which are deleted 
 "deleted": [], 
 //name of the tags created by the script 
 "tagged": []
 }  
```
